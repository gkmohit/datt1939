                    Sheetface: Social Media Satire
                </p>
                <p class="article-body">
                    2. <br>
                    When making a social media satire, we felt making a playful web-based art piece, from column A, suited this project best as it’s a playful satire that, in this way, becomes an art piece. For column B, we think that the idea of play related to social media fits with the definition of activity for amusement or recreation, which is what social media is itself, and helped push our starting themes forward. We took some inspiration from Ian Bogost by focusing on procedural rhetoric to persuade people in understanding problems that can exist with social media and popular culture. For column D we chose a JavaScript oriented project. 

                </p>
                <p class="article-body"> 
                    3. <br>
                    We, after a lot of process and deliberation, leaned on a satire of social media and popular culture, and how it can be pretty messed up what people put on there but somehow becomes normalized and how anything and everything can become interesting and popular if it’s talked about enough. We chose Sheetface as a kind of pun and play on Facebook (book being sheet and in reverse order). It set the tone very quickly and coming up with modern inspired satirical pieces was very easy as, to be fair, a lot of what’s out there is strange as is, we simply had to turn a few things around. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-body"> 
                    We chose Claymation as the style for the people because it’s different and a little unexpected. It’s the truth, in some ways, as most people put up a static picture of themselves might as well be Claymation dolls, like puppets, because they’ll believe whatever pop culture tells them, at least that’s what we’re trying to make more aware. More on the Claymation, you might notice their names and bios are very graphic, weird, or strange and that’s because you never really know what someone is like through a little picture, this targets the idea of “don’t judge a book by its cover” as some of the more adorable or normal looking figures are the messed up ones. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-body"> 
                    The whole world, then, is supposed to be nonsensical and this nonsensicality is supposed to be normal for these people, as our nonsensicality is normal to us. A lot of features on the site might be strange or broken, such as home going to your main page but clicking the top left Sheetface button taking you to the face and login screen, it’s supposed to be a broken experience for the player, challenging what they might be used to clicking on more “mainstream designed” social media websites. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-body"> 
                    The color scheme, the overall placement and look, it makes it interesting to see how much we can find out in this environment and how willing someone might be to explore the space. Even the games, being a necessary aspect of social media, play on what people normally expect from little browser games, being a little disappointing and pointless but strange as well. The chat boxes are unresponsive and annoying and not being able to click like but being prompted to click it makes it seem legitimate but actually serves to show the player just how little their input would’ve have mattered regardless.
                </p>
                <p class="article-body">
                    The articles themselves connect and tell a narrative that’s more than strange and more than anyone we know would expect to be great trending news. The articles are written with point to make fun of what’s currently being talked about and what we thought would be interesting to see, and to see people believe. The articles are purposely badly written, rife with spelling mistakes here and there, as are the newsfeed updates, to show the normalizing of nonsensicality. Sometimes pictures are missing, titles are missing, things you’d expect and the ways in which articles are usually written go a little topsy-turvy; you realize just what you grew to expect from a well-designed and subtle news article website.

                    For the JavaScript section of this project, we have used many different aspects of it. We make use of randInt a lot all through out the project. We have also used javascript object and dom element manupilation. Under dom element manupilation we have getClassByName , getElementById and innerHTML. We have also used some css aspects of Bootstrap
